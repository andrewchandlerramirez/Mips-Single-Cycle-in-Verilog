# Mips-Single-Cycle-in-Verilog

This is a project I decided to do in August one summer.
It is a single cycle Mips Processor written using verilog in Vivado.

I used the book Computer Organization And Design 5thEdition by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy
Chapter 4 describes how all the components work and that is what I used to put this together. 

Instructions used in the Instruction memory are also included in Instructions.txt
The block diagram of the design is included in Mips_Single_Cycle.pdf
